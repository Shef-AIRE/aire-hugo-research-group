The AIRE team recently received a donation from alumni medics, [Dr Dinesh Selvarajah](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/people/clinical-medicine/dinesh-selvarajah) and Dr Sandra Naik. We are most grateful to the donors for their support of our mission to conduct leading AI/machine learning research. Their backing not only propels our current initiatives but also highlights the collaborative spirit essential for tackling complex health conditions.
