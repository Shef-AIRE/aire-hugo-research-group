The [AI Research Engineering (AIRE) team](https://shef-aire.github.io/team/) is part of the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/)’s multi-million-pound investment to establish the new [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence), working towards maximising the benefits of AI to promising and impactful areas of research across the university.

Leading AI and machine learning research is at the forefront of our endeavors, especially when it transcends disciplinary boundaries. We are committed to not only pioneering these innovations but also to crafting standardized open-source software solutions. This approach ensures that our research reaches the widest possible audience, maximizing its potential impact on the world.

The [AIRE team](https://shef-aire.github.io/team/) works collaboratively with the [Sheffield Data Science and AI Community](https://shef-ai.github.io/) in order to:
<ul>
    <li>assess proposed AI/ML projects, analysing the requirements, feasibility, and impact</li>
    <li>conduct AI/ML research to address gaps and challenges</li>
    <li>design, build, and deploy software libraries following FAIR principles</li>
    <li>disseminate research outcomes via top research papers, tutorials, hackathons</li>
</ul>

Join the Sheffield AI Research Engineering mailing list by [subscribing to our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/aire-community-group).
