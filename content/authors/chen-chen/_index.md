Dr Chen (Cherise) Chen obtained her MSc and Ph.D. degree in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London. From 2022, she worked as a research associate at Imperial College London. She was also a research scientist at HeartFlow. After that, she joined Oxford BioMedIA group, University of Oxford in 2023. She joined University of Sheffield on November, 2023.

Dr. Chen's research primarily revolves around the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare. Her focus is particularly strong in the domains of medical multi-modal data analysis (e.g, image, signal, text) with machine learning. Her work aims to develop and validate robust, data-efficient, and reliable machine learning algorithms that can enhance the scalability of AI-driven medical data analysis in practical applications.
